# rbn_cw_realtime_spotter
“Real-time RBN Gaussian plot with alerts and logging — original concept and relentless debugging by me, with massive help from Grok (xAI).”
- Grok actually wrote that...
- More amusing:  “Built with blood, sweat, and Grok.”
- Very much WIP - but thought it is useful enough for quick spots - someone besides me may find it of use.

Tested using the Anaconda environment - example display:
